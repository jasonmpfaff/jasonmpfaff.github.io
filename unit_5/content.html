								  <p class="imgDescription" id="imgDescription1">The Big Data movement feels stalled. What started as a noble idea, to capture all of the moving parts of our digital ecosystem and capture them as data points in a model to produce insights, turned into a movement. Seemingly overnight “Data Scientists” were everywhere and it was the job of the moment.  \We told ourselves this data was the promised land.We simply needed to sit back, let the brains crunch some numbers with their shiny new toys, and the decisions would start to make themselves.  Heck, we could even fully automate the decision making we thought, which would leave us all more time to count all of the money we were going to make.

								  But then, like, nothing happened.</p>

	  							<p class="imgDescription" id="imgDescription2">User experience designers refer to the uncomfortable barriers between a product and the users full enjoyment and realization of it as friction. From the moment you open the box, the Oculus Rift produces a lot of friction.  You have to purchase a premium PC, you have to tether the Rift to the PC, and your games and content are delivered via massive file downloads that take minutes with complicated configurations and set up. The Oculus Rift has the most friction inherent in its product than any hyped consumer product release I can remember.  What does that mean for its future?</p>

	 					<p class="imgDescription" id="imgDescription2">The web has become one of the most important fixtures of our daily lives, but for all of its innovation, its still very flat and two dimensional. That is all about to change. The flat and shallow web we have come to know, with its volumes of words that fit neatly into square blocks, is about to look and feel radically different.</p>
